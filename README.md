# Installation

For now, copy index.d.ts and include it into your angular project.
After some refactoring and optimization has been done, this will be forwarded to be availble via @types.

## Installation via AngularCLI
If you are using angularcli, create a new folder under node_modules/@types, call it "leaflet-search" and save index.d.ts there.

Include it like this in your component: `include 'leaflet-search'` and add the dependencies under "scripts" in your angular-cli.json.
